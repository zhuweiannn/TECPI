This repository contains the essential code and scripts used in our study, "Integrating machine learning and multi-omics analysis to develop the tumor evolutionary characteristics for improving prognosis and precision treatment in prostate cancer". The study focuses on integrating machine learning and multi-omics analysis to develop the Tumor Evolutionary Characteristic Predictive Indicator (TECPI) for improving prognosis and precision treatment in prostate cancer.

1.	Introduction：This repository provides the codebase for implementing the TECPI model as described in our paper. TECPI leverages machine learning algorithms and multi-omics data to predict prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responses. The repository includes the necessary scripts for data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluation.
